# Size



An enum describing a size in generic terms.

The size enum is used to describe sizes in multiple situations - for example margin, image, and heading sizes. The
specific meaning of these values is dependent on the client, and it is possible that multiple values may be mapped to
the same size in some implementations.

## Values

| Value | Description |
| ---| --- |
| `lg` | Large |
| `md` | Medium |
| `sm` | Small |
| `xl` | Extra large |
| `xs` | Extra small |
