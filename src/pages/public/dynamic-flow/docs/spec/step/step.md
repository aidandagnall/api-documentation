# Step



A step represents a single screen in a flow. It is made up of schemas, which represent data to be collected from the
user, layouts which describe how the screen looks, and a number of advanced features to provide more complex
behaviours.

### Step Response

A response is determined to be a Step when the status code is in the 200-299 range, the `exit` property in the triggering action was not set to `true`, and the `X-DF-Response-Type: step` header is provided.

## Properties

{% table %}
* Property

  Additional data to be included in analytics events. The keys/values in this object will be included in all events generated by clients.
---
* `errors`
* [StepError](../feature/step-error#Step-Error)
* No
*
  Errors which will be shown when the step loads.
---
* `external`
* [External](../feature/external#External)
* No
*
  Used to configure an app or web page to be opened when the step is first loaded.
---
* `id`
* String
* Yes
*
  An identifier which is added to analytics events as `stepId`.
---
* `layout`
* Array<[Layout](../layout/layout#Layout)>
* Yes
*
  An array of layouts describing how the step should be structured.
---
* `linkHandlers`
* Array<[LinkHandler](../feature/link-handler#Link-Handler)>
* No
*
  Used to configure deep/universal link handling, allowing the flow to progress based on incoming redirects/links.
---
* `model`
* Any
* No
*
  The data to use when initialising the step. It must follow the structure the schemas array describes, and any data which doesn't correspond to the schema is ignored.
---
* `navigation`
* [Navigation](../feature/navigation#Navigation)
* No
*
  Used to configure navigational behaviour of the step, for example to provide an [Action](../feature/action#Action) to perform when navigating back.
---
* `polling`

* No
*
  Used to configure a polling behaviour, allowing the flow to progress automatically.
---
* `refreshUrl`
* String
* No
*
  The URL to use to fetch an updated step when the value of a schema marked refreshStepOnChange is updated.
---
* `schemas`
* Array<[Schema](../schema/schema#Schema)>
* Yes
*
  An array of schemas describing the data for the user to input. Each root schemas which should be displayed to the user must be referenced by a [Form Layout](../layout/form-layout#Form-Layout) in the `layout` property. If a schema is not referenced by a [Form Layout](../layout/form-layout#Form-Layout), it won't be displayed, but it will still be submitted. On submission, the values corresponding to each element in the `schemas` array will be merged, as if they were contained in an [All Of Schema](../schema/all-of-schema#All-Of-Schema).
---
* `title`
* String
* Yes
*
  A user-facing title.
